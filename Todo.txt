TODO - List of desired functionality for the spike toolbox

$Id: Todo.txt 124 2005-02-22 16:34:38Z dylan $

--- Desired functionality
* ADD A TUTORIAL
* Create an STPlot wrapper to handle spike train definitions
* Create a function that can create a piecewise concatenation of spike trains from some definition
* Create a function to generate a set of spike trains from a matrix of data (linear or otherwise transformation)
* [Create MEX links to stimulate via the PCI_AER board] <-- Matthias
* Add code to STMultiplex to handle really big spike trains (ie maintain them in chunk format)
* Move internal functions to a private directory sturucture (move to v0.03?)
* Incorporate basic documentation into the matlab documentation browser
* Create a table of contents file containing documentation
* Add support for PCIAER mapping funtionality
* Fix STCrop to support spike train instances
* Make warnings suppressable, especially 'zero duration train' warnings

--- Implemented functionality
* Modified STInstantiate, STMap, STMultiplex and STPlotRaster to handle cell arrays of spike trains.
* Create a function to export a mapped train in a format suitable for sending to the PCI_AER board.
* Create an STFlatten function to convert a mapping back to an instance.
* Modify all functions to handle zero-length spiketrains.
* Modify STConcat to handle cell arrays of spike trains.
* Modify the mapped spiketrain format to be something like neuron.synapse for addresses.
* Add an STExtract function to extract a single address' (or neuron?) spike train from a multiplexed mapping.
* Modify STMultiplex to handle spike train arrays nicely.
* Create an STCrop or STTrim function to crop a spike train to a specific time duration.
* Modified files to display correctly when using 'help' function
* Added an 'info.xml' file
* Make general address translation functionality (physical and logical addresses)

Revision 2.4  2005/02/19 16:33:01  dylan
Added some stuff to Todo.txt (nonote)

Revision 2.3  2004/10/27 17:23:35  dylan
Added a feature request to Todo (nonote)

Revision 2.2  2004/08/25 12:49:22  dylan
* Fixed a bug in STMultiplex, where spike trains with different levels
could not be multiplexed, even if they shared a common level.
STMultiplex now requires CellForEachCell, in the utilities repository.

* Added a feature request to Todo.txt

Revision 2.1  2004/07/19 16:21:03  dylan
* Major update of the spike toolbox (moving to v0.02)

* Modified the procedure for retrieving and setting toolbox options.  The new
suite of functions comprises of STOptions, STOptionsLoad, STOptionsSave,
STOptionsDescribe, STCreateGlobals and STIsValidOptionsStruct.  Spike Toolbox
'factory default' options are defined in STToolboxDefaults.  Options can be
saved as user defaults using STOptionsSave, and will be loaded automatically
for each session.

* Removed STAccessDefaults and STCreateDefaults.

* Renamed STLogicalAddressConstruct, STLogicalAddressExtract,
STPhysicalAddressContstruct and STPhysicalAddressExtract to
STAddr<type><verb>

* Drastically modified the way synapse addresses are specified for the
toolbox.  A more generic approach is now taken, where addressing modes are
defined by structures that outline the meaning of each bit-field in a
physical address.  Fields can have their bits reversed, can be ignored, can
have a description attached, and can be marked as major or minor fields.
Any type of neuron/synapse topology can be addressed in this way, including
2D neuron arrays and chips with no separate synapse addresses.

The following functions were created to handle this new addressing mode:
STAddrDescribe, STAddrFilterArgs, STAddrSpecChannel, STAddrSpecCompare,
STAddrSpecDescribe, STAddrSpecFill, STAddrSpecIgnoreSynapseNeuron,
STAddrSpecInfo, STAddrSpecSynapse2DNeuron, STIsValidAddress, STIsValidAddrSpec,
STIsValidChannelAddrSpec and STIsValidMonitorChannelsSpecification.

This modification required changes to STAddrLogicalConstruct and Extract,
STAddrPhysicalConstruct and Extract, STCreate, STExport, STImport,
STStimulate, STMap, STCrop, STConcat and STMultiplex.

* Removed the channel filter functions.

* Modified STDescribe to handle the majority of toolbox variable types.
This function will now describe spike trains, addressing specifications and
spike toolbox options.  Added STAddrDescribe, STOptionsDescribe and
STTrainDescribe.

* Added an STIsValidSpikeTrain function to test the validity of a spike
train structure.  Modified many spike train manipulation functions to use
this feature.

* Added features to Todo.txt, updated Readme.txt

* Added an info.xml file, added a welcome HTML file (spike_tb_welcome.html)
and associated images (an_spike-big.jpg, an_spike.gif)

Revision 2.0  2004/07/13 12:56:32  dylan
Moving to version 0.02 (nonote)

Revision 1.3  2004/07/13 12:55:20  dylan
(nonote)

Revision 1.2  2004/07/12 10:10:34  dylan
Modified STExport to use [isi addr] format.  Added a feature request to Todo.txt

Revision 1.1  2004/06/04 09:35:49  dylan
Reimported (nonote)

Revision 1.15  2004/05/14 15:37:19  dylan
* Created utilities/CellFlatten.m -- CellFlatten coverts a list of items
into a cell array containing a single cell for each item.  CellFlatten will
also flatten the heirarchy of a nested cell array, returning all cell
elements on a single dimension
* Created utiltites/CellForEach.m -- CellForEach executes a specified
function for each top-level element of a cell array, and returns a matrix of
the results.
* Converted spike_tb/STFindMatchingLevel to natively process cell arrays of trains
* Converted spike_tb/STMultiplex to natively process cell arrays of trains
* Created spike_tb/STCrop.m -- STCrop will crop a spike train to a specified
time extent
* Created spike_tb/STNormalise.m -- STNormalise will shift a spike train to
begin at zero (first spike is at zero) and correct the duration

Revision 1.14  2004/05/09 17:55:15  dylan
* Created STFlatten function to convert a spike train mapping back into an
instance.
* Created STExtract function to extract a train(s) from a multiplexed
mapped spike train
* Renamed STConstructAddress to STConstructPhysicalAddress
* Modified the address format for spike train mappings such that the
integer component of an address specifies the neuron.  This makes raster
plots much easier to read.  The format is now
|NEURON_BITS|.|SYNAPSE_BITS|  This is now referred to as a logical
address.  The format required by the PCIAER board is referred to as a
physical address.
* Created STConstructLogicalAddress and STExtractLogicalAddress to
convert neuron and synapse IDs to and from logical addresses
* Created STExtractPhysicalAddress to convert a physical address back to
neuron and synapse IDs
* Modified STConstructPhysicalAddress so that it accepts vectorised input
* Modified STConcat so that it accepts cell arrays of spike trains to
concatenate
* Modified STExport, STImport so that they handle logical / physical
addresses
* Fixed a bug in STMultiplex and STConcat where spike event addresses were
modified when temporal resolutions were different across spike trains
* Modified STFormats to reflect addresss format changes
