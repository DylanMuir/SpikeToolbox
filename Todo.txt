TODO - List of desired functionality for the spike toolbox

$Id: Todo.txt,v 1.2 2004/07/12 10:10:34 dylan Exp $

--- Desired functionality
* Create an STPlot wrapper to handle spike train definitions.
* Create a function that can create a piecewise concatenation of spike trains from a definition.
* Create a table of contents file containing documentation.
* Create a function to generate a set of spike trains from a matrix of data (linear or otherwise transformation).
* [Create MEX links to stimulate via the PCI_AER board.]
* Create an STCrop or STTrim function to crop a spike train to a specific time duration.
* Add code to STMultiplex to handle really big spike trains (ie maintain them in chunk format)
* Make general address translation functionality (physical and logical addresses)


--- Implemented functionality
* Modified STInstantiate, STMap, STMultiplex and STPlotRaster to handle cell arrays of spike trains.
* Create a function to export a mapped train in a format suitable for sending to the PCI_AER board.
* Create an STFlatten function to convert a mapping back to an instance.
* Modify all functions to handle zero-length spiketrains.
* Modify STConcat to handle cell arrays of spike trains.
* Modify the mapped spiketrain format to be something like neuron.synapse for addresses.
* Add an STExtract function to extract a single address' (or neuron?) spike train from a multiplexed mapping.
* Modify STMultiplex to handle spike train arrays nicely.

Revision 1.2  2004/07/12 10:10:34  dylan
Modified STExport to use [isi addr] format.  Added a feature request to Todo.txt

Revision 1.1  2004/06/04 09:35:49  dylan
Reimported (nonote)

Revision 1.15  2004/05/14 15:37:19  dylan
* Created utilities/CellFlatten.m -- CellFlatten coverts a list of items
into a cell array containing a single cell for each item.  CellFlatten will
also flatten the heirarchy of a nested cell array, returning all cell
elements on a single dimension
* Created utiltites/CellForEach.m -- CellForEach executes a specified
function for each top-level element of a cell array, and returns a matrix of
the results.
* Converted spike_tb/STFindMatchingLevel to natively process cell arrays of trains
* Converted spike_tb/STMultiplex to natively process cell arrays of trains
* Created spike_tb/STCrop.m -- STCrop will crop a spike train to a specified
time extent
* Created spike_tb/STNormalise.m -- STNormalise will shift a spike train to
begin at zero (first spike is at zero) and correct the duration

Revision 1.14  2004/05/09 17:55:15  dylan
* Created STFlatten function to convert a spike train mapping back into an
instance.
* Created STExtract function to extract a train(s) from a multiplexed
mapped spike train
* Renamed STConstructAddress to STConstructPhysicalAddress
* Modified the address format for spike train mappings such that the
integer component of an address specifies the neuron.  This makes raster
plots much easier to read.  The format is now
|NEURON_BITS|.|SYNAPSE_BITS|  This is now referred to as a logical
address.  The format required by the PCIAER board is referred to as a
physical address.
* Created STConstructLogicalAddress and STExtractLogicalAddress to
convert neuron and synapse IDs to and from logical addresses
* Created STExtractPhysicalAddress to convert a physical address back to
neuron and synapse IDs
* Modified STConstructPhysicalAddress so that it accepts vectorised input
* Modified STConcat so that it accepts cell arrays of spike trains to
concatenate
* Modified STExport, STImport so that they handle logical / physical
addresses
* Fixed a bug in STMultiplex and STConcat where spike event addresses were
modified when temporal resolutions were different across spike trains
* Modified STFormats to reflect addresss format changes
