TODO - List of desired functionality for the spike toolbox

--- Desired functionality
* Fix STExtract so that it has a reasonable interpretation for minimum and maximum addresses (ie a per-field inclusion rather than an everything-in-between inclusion)
* Create a function that can create a piecewise concatenation of spike trains from some definition
* Create a function to generate a set of spike trains from a matrix of data (linear or otherwise transformation)
* Incorporate MEX links to configure mapper <-- Matthias
* Add code to STMultiplex to handle really big spike trains (ie maintain them in chunk format)
* Make warnings suppressable, especially 'zero duration train' warnings
* See if http://glab.bcm.tmc.edu/signal_processing_techniques/spt_data_ana_theor_rout.html has any good ideas for functionality
* Make all plotting functions "sub-plottable"
* Use comb filtering of ISIs for poisson spike generation

--- Implemented functionality
* Modified STInstantiate, STMap, STMultiplex and STPlotRaster to handle cell arrays of spike trains.
* Create a function to export a mapped train in a format suitable for sending to the PCI_AER board.
* Create an STFlatten function to convert a mapping back to an instance.
* Modify all functions to handle zero-length spiketrains.
* Modify STConcat to handle cell arrays of spike trains.
* Modify the mapped spiketrain format to be something like neuron.synapse for addresses.
* Add an STExtract function to extract a single address' (or neuron?) spike train from a multiplexed mapping.
* Modify STMultiplex to handle spike train arrays nicely.
* Create an STCrop or STTrim function to crop a spike train to a specific time duration.
* Modified files to display correctly when using 'help' function
* Added an 'info.xml' file
* Make general address translation functionality (physical and logical addresses)
* Move internal functions to a private directory sturucture
* Create an STPlotDef wrapper to handle spike train definitions
* Incorporate spike train generation using gamma ISI pdf
* Devise a way to make correlated spiketrains
* Make progress supressable
* ADD A TUTORIAL
* Remove dependence on 'stimmon', replace with a MEX function (in progress)
* Incorporate basic documentation into the matlab documentation browser
* Create a table of contents file containing documentation
* Fix STCrop to support spike train instances (import from BoNS code)
* Add memory (non-ergodic) capability for spike-train generation
* Implement STPlotInstFreq to plot ISIs a la Hahnloser
* Fix STStimulate so it observes the monitor channel specifications
