% Revision 2.2  2004/09/16 11:45:23  dylan
% Updated help text layout for all functions
%
% Revision 2.1  2004/07/19 16:21:03  dylan
% * Major update of the spike toolbox (moving to v0.02)
%
% * Modified the procedure for retrieving and setting toolbox options.  The new
% suite of functions comprises of STOptions, STOptionsLoad, STOptionsSave,
% STOptionsDescribe, STCreateGlobals and STIsValidOptionsStruct.  Spike Toolbox
% 'factory default' options are defined in STToolboxDefaults.  Options can be
% saved as user defaults using STOptionsSave, and will be loaded automatically
% for each session.
%
% * Removed STAccessDefaults and STCreateDefaults.
%
% * Renamed STLogicalAddressConstruct, STLogicalAddressExtract,
% STPhysicalAddressContstruct and STPhysicalAddressExtract to
% STAddr<type><verb>
%
% * Drastically modified the way synapse addresses are specified for the
% toolbox.  A more generic approach is now taken, where addressing modes are
% defined by structures that outline the meaning of each bit-field in a
% physical address.  Fields can have their bits reversed, can be ignored, can
% have a description attached, and can be marked as major or minor fields.
% Any type of neuron/synapse topology can be addressed in this way, including
% 2D neuron arrays and chips with no separate synapse addresses.
%
% The following functions were created to handle this new addressing mode:
% STAddrDescribe, STAddrFilterArgs, STAddrSpecChannel, STAddrSpecCompare,
% STAddrSpecDescribe, STAddrSpecFill, STAddrSpecIgnoreSynapseNeuron,
% STAddrSpecInfo, STAddrSpecSynapse2DNeuron, STIsValidAddress, STIsValidAddrSpec,
% STIsValidChannelAddrSpec and STIsValidMonitorChannelsSpecification.
%
% This modification required changes to STAddrLogicalConstruct and Extract,
% STAddrPhysicalConstruct and Extract, STCreate, STExport, STImport,
% STStimulate, STMap, STCrop, STConcat and STMultiplex.
%
% * Removed the channel filter functions.
%
% * Modified STDescribe to handle the majority of toolbox variable types.
% This function will now describe spike trains, addressing specifications and
% spike toolbox options.  Added STAddrDescribe, STOptionsDescribe and
% STTrainDescribe.
%
% * Added an STIsValidSpikeTrain function to test the validity of a spike
% train structure.  Modified many spike train manipulation functions to use
% this feature.
%
% * Added features to Todo.txt, updated Readme.txt
%
% * Added an info.xml file, added a welcome HTML file (spike_tb_welcome.html)
% and associated images (an_spike-big.jpg, an_spike.gif)

% Revision 2.0  2004/07/13 12:56:32  dylan
% Moving to version 0.02 (nonote)

% Revision 1.1  2004/06/04 09:35:49  dylan
% Reimported (nonote)
%
% Revision 1.3  2004/05/19 07:56:50  dylan
% * Modified the syntax of STImport -- STImport now uses an updated version
% of stimmon, which acquires data from all four PCI-AER channels.  STImport
% now imports to a cell array of spike trains, one per channel imported.
% Which channels to import can be specified through the calling syntax.
% * STImport uses channel filter functions to handle different addressing
% formats on the AER bus.  Added two standard filter functions:
% STChannelFilterNeuron and STChannelFilterNeuronSynapse.  Added help files
% for this functionality: STChannelFiltersDescription,
% STChannelFilterDevelop
